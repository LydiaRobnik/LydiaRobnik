Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am Lydia, graduated in business administration with focus on sports management and currently completing a bootcamp in web and app development at WBS Coding School. We learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SQL, NodeJS, Express and MongoDB.

Over the past twelve years I gained working experience in project management in psychosomatic research and in agile methods. I am highly interested in learning new things and love creative crafting projects (like sewing or restoring an old bike).

I like hiking, skiing, Yoga, biking, swimming, and puzzles.
